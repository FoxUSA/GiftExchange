# [Gift Exchange Generator][pages]

[![A demo of generating a list and clicking to reveal who I picked](./docs/images/demo.gif)][pages]

A responsive 'Secret Santa' style gift exchange picker/matcher where you don't have to give a random service your emails. You can self host it or just use it [here on GitHub][pages]. Instead of drawing just one name it is configurable. 1,2,3,4+ assignments, no problem.

[Demo/App/Its right here just click it.][pages]

## Matching requirements
- Picks are random
- Cannot pick yourself
- Cannot get the same person twice
- Everyone must have the same number of gifts
- Exclusions must be honored
